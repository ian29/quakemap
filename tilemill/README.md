## QuakeMap

This is a simple [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/) project designed to quickly visualize psa03 data from the [USGS ShakeMap product](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/). Just drop the relevant psa03 shapefile into the `layers` directory and you should be good to go.
